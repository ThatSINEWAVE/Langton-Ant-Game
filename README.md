Welcome to Langton's Ant Game, a fascinating simulation of an ant's movement based on simple rules.

</div>

## Overview
Langton's Ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine invented by Chris Langton in 1986. It takes place on an infinite grid of square cells, each of which can be either white or black. The ant moves according to the color of the cell it is currently on and follows these rules:
- At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, and move forward one unit.
- At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, and move forward one unit.

Over time, the ant's seemingly chaotic movements produce a predictable pattern.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Simulation:** Click the "Begin" button to start the simulation.
2. **Control the Simulation:**
   - **Pause/Resume:** Click the "Pause" button to pause or resume the simulation.
   - **Adjust Speed:** Use the speed input box to set the speed of the simulation (in milliseconds) and click "Apply" to update the speed.
